Time Log:
1) 20 Minutes. Set up github and got a very basic app running
2) 2 hours. Researching and implementing a task struct in swift. 
3) 3 hours. I had to restart my implementation because I started it with a list
	    template but in reality it was easier to do it myself that way I
	    learn more about the layout and features included in XCode. I was
	    able to get it to add tasks to a list.
4) 1 hour. I was able to get it onto my phone and it works as it did in the
	   simulator. I also got a very basic app logo.

This project began a little rough because I was confused by the drag and drop to
connect different pages because it gave little useful information about what
can and cannot be connected and also the things that need to be connected do
not show any signs of life until you hover over it. Other than that, it was
difficult to find out how to use non-swfit code such as C/C++, but my partner
said he was going to learn how to do that while I work on trying to get the 
interface to properly function and the buttons connected to the correct piece
of code but then we are going to both work on adding more functionality in
terms of more methods and more buttons connected to those methods. I enjoy this
project so far and find myself looking forward to working on this and learning 
more about making an app and the different developer tools baked into XCode.
